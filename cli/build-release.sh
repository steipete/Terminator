# Swift compiler and linker flags for optimization and size reduction
# -Osize: Optimize for code size.
# -wmo: Whole Module Optimization.
# -Xlinker -dead_strip: Remove unused code at the link stage.
# -Xswiftc -static-stdlib: Statically link the Swift standard library (can increase size but removes external dependencies - consider if needed, often not for CLI tools that can rely on system Swift libs)
# For now, let's not use -static-stdlib to keep size smaller if possible. If dynamic linking becomes an issue, we can add it.
# SWIFT_BUILD_FLAGS="-Osize -wmo -Xlinker -dead_strip"
# The `swift build -c release` command already applies optimizations.
# -Osize needs to be passed via -Xswiftc
# -wmo is default for release builds
# -dead_strip is generally good.
